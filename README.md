# small-projects

Here I will keep track of all the projects in this repo.

## Scrolling and stuff

- In this project I try my hand at some dynamic elements of a website like smooth scrolling.
- a back to top button.
- animated navigation bar.
- Side menu.

## video in javascript

- I try to implement play/pause controls of a video using a toggle button coded in javascript.
- Giving the video an overlay color of black just to make the heading more visible.
- Adding a preloader nyan cat üê±.

## sidebar

- This is just an early study of how to create a basic sidebar menu.
